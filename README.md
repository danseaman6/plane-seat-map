React-Create-App was used to build the framework. The only added dependencies are [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/getting-started/introduction/) and [wretch](https://github.com/elbywan/wretch).

I don't do a lot of CSS myself these days, so I built my own components but relied fairly heavily on some of Bootstrap's styling; notably the Container/Row/Col layout structure and the Button styling. 
If someone else has already done it, might as well use it.
